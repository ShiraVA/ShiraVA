- 👋 Hi, I’m @ShiraVA
- 👀 I’m interested in Digital Art and Coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to Code on multiple platforms to create my legacy (Still just a hobby)
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to automate and make an "all in one" discord bot
- 🌷 My project is still a work in progress but it is already fully functional:
♦ - https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=738046780431925390&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=2146958847
